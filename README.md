# WinningPy
Toy python chess engine

WinningPy is a possibly slightly buggy, but more or less functional chess engine, 
written for the purpose of learning some object oriented programming in python. 
Its development was cut short by actual work coming up, but it is possible to play a game against it. 

Its most prominent feature is the shiny ascii output, which unfortunately doesn't work well in this README.
Moves are entered as combination of starting square and target square. 
For example e2e4 would be a common opening move. 
Castling is entered as king's move: e1g1 or e1c1.
